<h2>Interests</h2>
<p>During the week I like to spend time with my girlfriend, family and friends that are still in town. When I'm alone I tend to browse the internet or play video games on my PS4 with my friends. My favorite game to play is Destiny 2 right now, I play it with my friends from the U.S. who I've been playing with for the last 3 years. On the weekends I like to go up to Ottawa and visit my friends that currently live up there and go out to the bars and clubs. I also used to play competitive soccer, but quit a couple years ago. I still enjoy playing whenever I can find the chance to.</p>
